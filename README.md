Queryable Billing
=================

This is a prototype on how to build a robust billing system using Apache Flink's Queryable State feature.

The project consists of two components, the queryable Flink job and a Spring Boot application that can query the job for its internal state.

Manual Testing
--------------
1. Check out [Apache Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink)'s master branch and build using maven, i.e. go to flink repo (from now on $FLINK_DIR) and
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
2. Start local flink
```
$FLINK_DIR/build-target/bin/start-local.sh
```
3. Assemble flink jar (now in this project's directory)
```
./gradlew qb-job:shadowJar 
```
4. Submit jar
```
$FLINK_DIR/build-target/bin/flink run qb-job/build/libs/qb-job-0.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```
5. Build qb-server via
```
./gradlew qb-server:bootRepackage
```
6. Start via (replace job id)
```
java -jar qb-server/build/libs/qb-server-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --flink.configDir=$FLINK_DIR/flink-dist/src/main/resources --flink.jobIdHex=c9e2b987304fe3314b329fe0d17b2c8b
```
